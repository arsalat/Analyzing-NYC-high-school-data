# Analyzing-NYC-high-school-data
One of the most controversial issues in the U.S. educational system is the efficacy of standardized tests, and whether they're unfair to certain groups. 
New York City has a significant immigrant population and is very diverse, so comparing demographic factors such as race, income, and gender with SAT scores is a good way to determine whether the SAT is a fair test. 
For example, if certain racial groups consistently perform better on the SAT, we would have some evidence that the SAT is unfair.

There's still quite a bit of analysis left to do, however. Here are some potential next steps:

Determing wheter there's a correlation between class size and SAT scores
Figuring out which neighborhoods have the best schools
If we combine this information with a dataset containing property values, we could find the least expensive neighborhoods that have good schools.
Investigating the differences between parent, teacher, and student responses to surveys.

Stay tuned, I will be updating this project soon!
