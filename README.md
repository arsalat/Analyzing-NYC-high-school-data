# Analyzing the relationship between SAT scores and other demographics for NYC high schools(gender, race and neighbourhoods)
One of the most controversial issues in the U.S. educational system is the efficacy of standardized tests, and whether they're unfair to certain groups. 
New York City has a significant immigrant population and is very diverse, so comparing demographic factors such as race, income, and gender with SAT scores is a good way to determine whether the SAT is a fair test. 
For example, if certain racial groups consistently perform better on the SAT, we would have some evidence that the SAT is unfair.


We will be working with the following datasets:

ap_2010.csv - Data on AP test results (https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Education/AP-College-Board-2010-School-Level-Results/itfs-ms3e)
class_size.csv - Data on class size (https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Education/2010-2011-Class-Size-School-level-detail/urz7-pzb3)
demographics.csv - Data on demographics (https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Education/School-Demographics-and-Accountability-Snapshot-20/ihfw-zy9j)
graduation.csv - Data on graduation outcomes (https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Education/Graduation-Outcomes-Classes-Of-2005-2010-School-Le/vh2h-md7a)
hs_directory.csv - A directory of high schools(https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Education/DOE-High-School-Directory-2014-2015/n3p6-zve2)
sat_results.csv - Data on SAT scores (https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Education/SAT-Results/f9bf-2cp4)
survey_all.txt - Data on surveys from all schools (https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Education/NYC-School-Survey-2011/mnz3-dyi8)
survey_d75.txt - Data on surveys from New York City district 75 (https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Education/NYC-School-Survey-2011/mnz3-dyi8)

All of these data sets are interrelated. We'll need to combine them into a single data set before we can find correlations.

There's still quite a bit of analysis left to do, however. Here are some potential next steps:

Determing wheter there's a correlation between class size and SAT scores
Figuring out which neighborhoods have the best schools
If we combine this information with a dataset containing property values, we could find the least expensive neighborhoods that have good schools.
Investigating the differences between parent, teacher, and student responses to surveys.

Stay tuned, I will be updating this project soon!
